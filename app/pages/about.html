    <h2>

    <p>

      Originally named "Milligan Software Solutions", XyberSolve was incorporated in California in 1999.
      Greg Milligan is President and sole member.

      <li>One contract at a time, unless arranged with client.</li>
      <li>Sub-contract only with the knowlege and agreement of primary client.</li>
      <li>Under promise and over deliver.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      I am open to all modern DevOps tools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given a greenfield project and tool discretion, my choices would include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure Automation: Terraform</li>
      <li>Configuration Management: Ansible</li>
      <li>Source Mangement: Git</li>
      <li>Continuous Integration: Jenkins</li>
      <li>Monitoring: Cloudwatch, CloudTrail or Nagios</li>
      <li>Collaboration: JIRA</li>
      <li>Containers: Docker, Swarm or Kubernetes (for larger requirements)</li>
      <li>Image Repositories: DockerHub, Docker Registry or ECR</li>
      <li>Messsage Brokering: RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ or AWS SQS</li>
      <li>Languages: NodeJs, Python, Bash, Make</li>
      <li>Infrastructure: AWS (EC2, S3, ECR, ECS, RDS, Route53, API Gateway, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Given a brownfield project: I learn existing systems and those targeted for improvement.
      I remain flexible to legacy or preferred technologies and provide
      suggestions where improvements might be realized.
    </p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Over the last 10 years, my development/deployment experience has been in LAMP, MEAN and MERN stacks.
      However, I have automated deployments for other environments, including Java and Python.
      Initially I worked in the Windows enviroment, writing and deploying compiled applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of the automation pipeline is similar across all environments.
      However, actual build & testing becomes specialized for a given environment.
    </p>

    <h2>Containers: Are the only way to go?</h2>
    <p>
      For my own business, I containerize any process I can.
      However, I also understand containers do not fit every requirement.
      I do endevour to use them whenever possible or reasonable.
    </p>

    <h2>
      My Photography
    </h2>
    <p>
      Why include my photography as a part of my development shingle?
      Good photography is about beauty in layout and composition.
      Perhaps my images will lend a perspective towards my views.
      Either way, I get to show off my pictures.

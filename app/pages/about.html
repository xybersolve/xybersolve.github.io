    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
      I am open to all modern DevOps tools.
    </p>

      <li><b>Infrastructure</b>: AWS (EC2, S3, ELB, ASG, ECS, ECR, RDS, Route53, API Gateway, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Scenario: Brownfield project &amp; legacy assets:
    </h3>

    <p>
      Learn existing systems and those targeted for improvement.
      Remain flexible to legacy or preferred technologies and provide suggestions,
      encouragement &amp; support where improvements might be realized.
    </p>

    <h2>Environments</h2>
    <p>
      Over the last 10 years, my development/deployment experience has been primarily in LAMP, MEAN and MERN stacks.
      However, in that time, I have automated deployments for other environments, including Java and Python.
      Before all this, I worked in the Windows enviroment, writing and deploying compiled applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      My time has been shared across shrinkwrap and production environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much of the automation pipeline is similar across all environments.
      However, actual build & testing becomes specialized for a given environment.
    </p>

    <h4>Containers: the way to go?</h4>
    <p>
      For my own business, I containerize any process I can.
      I also understand containers do not fit every requirement.
      I do endevour to use them whenever possible or reasonable.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Photography
    </h2>
    <p>
      Why would one include photography as part of thier development shingle?
      Well, good photography is about beauty in layout and composition.
      Maybe my images might even lend insight towards my perspectives?
      Either way, I get to show off my pictures.
